# UTE5

This is a UNIX Terminal Emulator for the BBC Micro,
written by Clive M. Rodgers for the Oxford University
Physics teaching laboratory, where their two HLH Orion
minicomputers were accessed from a lab full of BBC
Micros with this emulator installed as the default
language ROM.

Some of Clive's original files are published (with his
kind permission) in the bbc/ directory.   The source
file in the top directory is my own disassembly and
reverse engineering, designed to be built using the
ca65 assembler.
