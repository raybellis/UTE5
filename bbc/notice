	A BBC MODEL B BASED COLOUR GRAPHICS TERMINAL FOR UNIX SYSTEMS

	Most terminal emulator ROMs for the BBC model B microcomputer are
emulations of the VT100 and Tektronix 4010 protocols. On studying the
market when setting up a Unix based undergraduate teaching course, I came
to the conclusion that all the available ROMs had one or more irritating
features that made them undesirable. For example, some of them will boot
up into a menu, rather than start as a terminal in the mode appropriate
to your system.  The VT100 protocol is fine for screen editing, but does
not have graphics. The Tektronix protocol is not bad for graphics, but
poor for screen editing.  Swapping between the two is often tedious.

	I therefore wrote a terminal ROM with Unix in mind, using all of
the facilities of the BBC that can be described in a termcap entry. The
result is sufficiently successful that I can offer it to other Unix users
who have similar requirements to ours.

	We can provide the Unix Terminal Emulator (UTE) customised to
your normal initial requirements of BBC screen mode, line speed, and
handshaking protocol (xon/xoff or hardware only), but there is a menu
which allows you to change these in unusual circumstances, or to enter BBC
Basic.

	The ROM comes with a termcap entries for screen modes 0 and 3,
and if you wish, a copy of the Emacs keys file that we use to assign the
function keys to the editing commands that we find most useful.
